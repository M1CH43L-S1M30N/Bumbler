### [Bumbler](https://mlsbumbler.herokuapp.com)
Welcome to Bumbler. This is my clone of Tumblr which I developed in under two weeks. Just like Tumlbr it has the ability to post pictures or text blogs which is what makes up most of the site. I made this single page app using Rubyfor my backend, ReactJS and Redux for the frontend and PostgreSQL for the database. Bumbler has all the basic social media app functions including creating, editing, deleting, and liking posts as well as following other users of the app.
